# Bad Copenheimer
A Python impelentation of a discord bot that acts as a server scanner.

This is a discord bot that will scan ip adresses to see if they are minecraft servers and will post the results in your channel.

## Current Status

Moving the bot to a slash command basis. Ultimate goal of clicking a link to add the bot then downloading the file of servers.

## Installation

[Installation Page](https://www.github.com/Pilot1782/bad_copenheimer/wiki/Installation)

## Usage
The first time you use this bot, run 

>/help

This shows all of the commands you can use and their usage. Then to create your server list, run:

>/server scan

This will get a list of all active minecraft servers, you may want to set the threads higher than the current value. This will take several hours to complete.

## Important

In order for !find and !status to work properly the server should have enable-query=true in the server.properties file

### All Possible Commands

>/help

>/status

>/server scan
